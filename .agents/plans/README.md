# Implementation Plans

This folder contains feature implementation plans generated by Claude Code.

## Purpose

Plans are created before implementing new features to:
- Document the approach before writing code
- Identify files to modify and create
- Break work into atomic, testable steps
- Track risks and considerations

## Workflow

1. **Create Plan**: Use `/project:core/plan-feature <description>` to generate a plan
2. **Review**: Validate the plan with stakeholders
3. **Execute**: Use `/project:core/execute .agents/plans/<plan-name>.md` to implement
4. **Archive**: Move completed plans to `completed/` subfolder (optional)

## Plan Structure

Each plan includes:
- Feature Overview
- Files to Modify/Create
- Implementation Steps
- Backend/Frontend Changes
- Validation Criteria
- Risks and Considerations
