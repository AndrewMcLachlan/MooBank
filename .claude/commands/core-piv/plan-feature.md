# Plan a new task

## Feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Mission

Transform a feature request into a **comprehensive implementation plan** through systematic codebase analysis, external research, and strategic planning.

**Core Principle**: We do NOT write code in this phase. Our goal is to create a context-rich implementation plan that enables one-pass implementation success for ai agents.

**Key Philosophy**: Context is King. The plan must contain ALL information needed for implementation - patterns, mandatory reading, documentation, validation commands - so the execution agent succeeds on the first attempt.

## Planning Process

### Phase 1: Feature Understanding

**Deep Feature Analysis:**

- Extract the core problem being solved
- Identify user value and business impact
- Determine feature type: New Capability/Enhancement/Refactor/Bug Fix
- Assess complexity: Low/Medium/High
- Map affected systems and components

**Create User Story Format Or Refine If Story Was Provided By The User:**

```
As a <type of user>
I want to <action/goal>
So that <benefit/value>
```

### Phase 2: Codebase Intelligence Gathering

**Use specialized agents and parallel analysis:**

**1. Project Structure Analysis**

- Detect primary language(s), frameworks, and runtime versions
- Map directory structure and architectural patterns
- Identify service/component boundaries and integration points
- Locate configuration files (pyproject.toml, package.json, etc.)
- Find environment setup and build processes

**2. Pattern Recognition** (Use specialized subagents when beneficial)

- Search for similar implementations in codebase
- Identify coding conventions:
  - Naming patterns (CamelCase, snake_case, kebab-case)
  - File organization and module structure
  - Error handling approaches
  - Logging patterns and standards
- Extract common patterns for the feature's domain
- Document anti-patterns to avoid
- Check CLAUDE.md for project-specific rules and conventions

**3. Dependency Analysis**

- Catalog external libraries relevant to feature
- Understand how libraries are integrated (check imports, configs)
- Find relevant documentation in docs/, ai_docs/, .agents/reference or ai-wiki if available
- Note library versions and compatibility requirements

**4. Testing Patterns**

- Identify test framework and structure (pytest, jest, etc.)
- Find similar test examples for reference
- Understand test organization (unit vs integration)
- Note coverage requirements and testing standards

**5. Integration Points**

- Identify existing files that need updates
- Determine new files that need creation and their locations
- Map router/API registration patterns
- Understand database/model patterns if applicable
- Identify authentication/authorization patterns if relevant

**Clarify Ambiguities:**

- If requirements are unclear at this point, ask the user to clarify before you continue
- Get specific implementation preferences (libraries, approaches, patterns)
- Resolve architectural decisions before proceeding

### Phase 3: External Research & Documentation

**Use specialized subagents when beneficial for external research:**

**Documentation Gathering:**

- Research latest library versions and best practices
- Find official documentation with specific section anchors
- Locate implementation examples and tutorials
- Identify common gotchas and known issues
- Check for breaking changes and migration guides

**Technology Trends:**

- Research current best practices for the technology stack
- Find relevant blog posts, guides, or case studies
- Identify performance optimization patterns
- Document security considerations

**Compile Research References:**

```markdown
## Relevant Documentation

- [Library Official Docs](https://example.com/docs#section)
  - Specific feature implementation guide
  - Why: Needed for X functionality
- [Framework Guide](https://example.com/guide#integration)
  - Integration patterns section
  - Why: Shows how to connect components
```

### Phase 4: Deep Strategic Thinking

**Think Harder About:**

- How does this feature fit into the existing architecture?
- What are the critical dependencies and order of operations?
- What could go wrong? (Edge cases, race conditions, errors)
- How will this be tested comprehensively?
- What performance implications exist?
- Are there security considerations?
- How maintainable is this approach?

**Design Decisions:**

- Choose between alternative approaches with clear rationale
- Design for extensibility and future modifications
- Plan for backward compatibility if needed
- Consider scalability implications

### Phase 5: Plan Structure Generation

**Create comprehensive plan with the following structure:**

Whats below here is a template for you to fill for th4e implementation agent:

```markdown
# Feature: <feature-name>

The following plan should be complete, but its important that you validate documentation and codebase patterns and task sanity before you start implementing.

Pay special attention to naming of existing utils types and models. Import from the right files etc.

## Feature Description

<Detailed description of the feature, its purpose, and value to users>

## User Story

As a <type of user>
I want to <action/goal>
So that <benefit/value>

## Problem Statement

<Clearly define the specific problem or opportunity this feature addresses>

## Solution Statement

<Describe the proposed solution approach and how it solves the problem>

## Feature Metadata

**Feature Type**: [New Capability/Enhancement/Refactor/Bug Fix]
**Estimated Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]
**Primary Systems Affected**: [List of main components/services]
**Dependencies**: [External libraries or services required]

---

## CONTEXT REFERENCES

### Relevant Codebase Files IMPORTANT: YOU MUST READ THESE FILES BEFORE IMPLEMENTING!

<List files with line numbers and relevance>

- `path/to/file.py` (lines 15-45) - Why: Contains pattern for X that we'll mirror
- `path/to/model.py` (lines 100-120) - Why: Database model structure to follow
- `path/to/test.py` - Why: Test pattern example

### New Files to Create

- `path/to/new_service.py` - Service implementation for X functionality
- `path/to/new_model.py` - Data model for Y resource
- `tests/path/to/test_new_service.py` - Unit tests for new service

### Relevant Documentation YOU SHOULD READ THESE BEFORE IMPLEMENTING!

- [Documentation Link 1](https://example.com/doc1#section)
  - Specific section: Authentication setup
  - Why: Required for implementing secure endpoints
- [Documentation Link 2](https://example.com/doc2#integration)
  - Specific section: Database integration
  - Why: Shows proper async database patterns

### Patterns to Follow

<Specific patterns extracted from codebase - include actual code examples from the project>

**Naming Conventions:** (for example)

**Error Handling:** (for example)

**Logging Pattern:** (for example)

**Other Relevant Patterns:** (for example)

- Configure necessary dependencies
- Create foundational utilities or helpers

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

<Describe the main implementation work>

**Tasks:**

## STEP-BY-STEP TASKS

IMPORTANT: Execute every task in order, top to bottom. Each task is atomic and independently testable.

### Task Format Guidelines

Use information-dense keywords for clarity:

- **CREATE**: New files or components
- **UPDATE**: Modify existing files
- **ADD**: Insert new functionality into existing code
- **REMOVE**: Delete deprecated code
- **REFACTOR**: Restructure without changing behavior
- **MIRROR**: Copy pattern from elsewhere in codebase

### {ACTION} {target_file}

- **IMPLEMENT**: {Specific implementation detail}
- **PATTERN**: {Reference to existing pattern - file:line}
- **IMPORTS**: {Required imports and dependencies}
- **GOTCHA**: {Known issues or constraints to avoid}
- **VALIDATE**: `{executable validation command}`

<Continue with all tasks in dependency order...>

---

## TESTING STRATEGY
