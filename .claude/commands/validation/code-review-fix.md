description: Process to fix bugs found in manual/AI code review
---

I ran/performed a code review and found these issues:

Code-review (file or description of issues): $1

Please fix these issues one by one. If the Code-review is a file read the entire file first to understand all of the issue(s) presented there.

Scope: $2

For each fix:
1. Explain what was wrong
2. Show the fix
3. Create and run relevant tests to verify

After all fixes, run the validate command (see commands/validate.md) to finalize your fixes.
